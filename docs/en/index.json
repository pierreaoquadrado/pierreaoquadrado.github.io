It has been posited that, despite its absence from practical implementation, this proposal possesses the capacity to engender an engaging learning environment by virtue of its foundation in a contemporary guiding question: for what reason are casino games and analogous pastimes designated as games of chance? Problem-Based Learning (PBL) is a pedagogical approach that incorporates a range of important tools, including brainstorming, webquests, rubrics and portfolios. The centrality of student-centered learning serves to enhance the efficacy of these tools in two key ways. Firstly, they function as promoters of ideas and discussions, and secondly, they play a pivotal role in the organization of the search for knowledge. In addition, the fabrication of artefacts through the utilization of 3D printing is introduced, thereby situating the present didactic proposal within the conceptual framework of STEAM education: interdisciplinarity, emphasis on the development of critical thinking and problem solving, innovation and creativity, the use of digital technologies and tools, and the encouragement of collaborative teamwork.\n","date":"3 November 2025","permalink":"https://pierreaoquadrado.github.io/en/posts/pir2/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"PBA and betting apps"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://pierreaoquadrado.github.io/en/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://pierreaoquadrado.github.io/en/tags/research/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Research"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://pierreaoquadrado.github.io/en/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://pierreaoquadrado.github.io/en/","section":"πR² - the roundness of a square!","summary":"","title":"πR² - the roundness of a square!"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://pierreaoquadrado.github.io/en/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
